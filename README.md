## Introduction

This project is the final project done for my Computer Science degree

This contains 3 apps;
- Doctorapp, A Next.js web app use for Doctors to interact with the system
- Healthapp, A Nest.js server use to communicate between users, calculate and reply request
- Mobileapp, An Expo/React Native mobile app use to interact with the system using you mobile device

This project focus on finding and testing different ways to take advantage of the different utilities offered by IoT devices, and more specifically Beacons, so that any patient can receive the most personalized care possible for their specific case when accessing a health center or hospital that has this type of devices installed.

For this purpose, a prototype has been implemented for both a mobile application that allows connection with Beacons and a web application for medical staff, with utilities resulting from the use of Beacons by patients. Different functionalities have been implemented, such as real-time gauging of a center, emergency detection, etc.

All of the above makes use of a centralized main server which retains or calculates all the necessary information and provides it to the different applications of the architecture. This server has also been implemented as part of this work.
